## Create Perturbed Histogram
```{r}
n = 100
eps = 0.1
m = 5

# Sample from original distribution
b_sample = rbeta(n=n, 10, 10)

v = hist(b_sample, plot=F, breaks=m-1, prob=T)

lap_sample = rlaplace(length(v$counts), 0, 8 / (eps^2))

# Perturbe the original distribution
v$counts
v$counts = v$counts + lap_sample
v$counts[v$counts <= 0] = 0

v$density = v$counts / sum(v$counts)
v$density
```


## Plot Perturbed Histogram
```{r}
# TODO plot the density and NOT the counts!
plot(v)
```
